# Cervical-Cancer-Prediction
Cervical_Cancer_Predection_with_ML
In this project, built and trained an XG-Boost classifier to predict whether a person has a risk of having cervical cancer. Data was obtained from 858 patients at 'Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in Caracas, Venezuela, and included features such as number of pregnancies, smoking habits, Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD), demographics, and historic medical records. Performed exploratory data analysis and data visualization of the training data set. Prepared the data and split it into training and test datasets before Model Training. XG-Boost-Algorithm was trained and evaluated for this task using the sci-kit library in Python. The Accuracy for this Machine Learning Model came out to be: 99.99 % (Training Dataset) and 95.348 % (Test Dataset)
